# 👋 Hi, I'm Andi Castillo-Mauricio

I'm a first-generation computer science graduate passionate about building real-world software that solves real-world problems. I enjoy working across the stack—from designing RESTful APIs to building responsive user interfaces—and I'm currently focused on strengthening my backend and cloud development skills.

🌱 Currently expanding my knowledge in cloud infrastructure through AWS learning plans.  
💻 Always looking to grow through hands-on projects, feedback, and real-world challenges.
